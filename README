Architecture Overview:
- Identity Provider (IdP): Issues access tokens after verifying the client's certificate.
- Protected API Server: Exposes an API secured with OAuth2, verifying the token from the IdP.
- Client Application: Uses a keypair and certificate to authenticate with the IdP and obtain an access token, then calls the protected API

Authentication Flow:
1- The client signs a request with its private key and presents the certificate.
2- The IdP verifies the certificate, authenticates the client, and issues an access token (JWT).
3- The client calls the protected API with the token.
4- The API validates the token with the IdPâ€™s public key.
